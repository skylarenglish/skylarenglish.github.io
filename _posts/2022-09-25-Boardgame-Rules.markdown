## Game Report
Each game report will include 
- Game Name
- Players in Place Order (winning player first, second second and so forth)
- Game start time
- Game end time
- Signatures of all players

## Points
Points will be awarded based on each Game Report

## Conceding
Conceding is encouraged once it becomes clear that a player is in the lead, especially if it seems like they are dragging the game out to earn extra points. The game can only be conceded as long as all players agree. What is written on the Game Report is final 

## No Repeats
