## Game Report
Each after game report will include:
- Game Name
- Players in Place Order (winning player first, second second and so forth)
- Game start time
- Game end time
- Signatures of all players

Points will be calculated for the players automatically, as long as you submit your Game Report correctly.

## Points
Points[^points] will be awarded based on each Game Report such that first place is worth the number of minutes played and last place is worth half as many points as first. The other places will subdivide the gap between first and last evenly[^intent].

For example:
> Let's say Skylar, Paul, Zack and Les play a zesty game of Dune Imperium
>
> They play for 145 minutes and Les wins (due to his Mentat training, no doubt)
>
> Zack comes in second place, Paul third and poor foolish Skylar comes in fourth.
>
> | Player | Game Time   | Score           |
> | Les    | 145 minutes | 145*(6/6) = 145 |
> | Zack   | 145 minutes | 145*(5/6) = 121 |
> | Paul   | 145 minutes | 145*(4/6) = 97  |
> | Skylar | 145 minutes | 145*(3/6) = 73  |

## Conceding Is Encouraged
Once it becomes clear that a player is in the lead, especially if it seems like they are dragging the game out to earn extra points, the other players should consider conceding.
The game can only be conceded as long as all players besides the winner agree and sign the Game Report. What is written on the Game Report is final.

## The Gauntlet
The two players with the highest cumulative SkylarScore®[^score] will be given the opportunity to decide who is best in an exhibition match Sunday involving the following 5 relatively quick games.

Hive
Mandala
Kiri-Ai The Duel
Battle Line
7 Wonders Duel

If you would like to be able to win the Gauntlet, it is recommended that you be aware of those games.

## No Repeats
You may not play the same game back to back.

## No Tricks


[^points]: t * (1+((1-p)/(2n-2))) where t = time, p = place order, and n = # of players [^index]
[^intent]: The idea is to reward playing but still penalize losing while maintaining a simple scoring rule
[^index]: as an example of why 0 indexing is nice, this simplifies to t * (1-(p/(2n-2))) when first place is 0
[^score]: Really just OpenSkill
