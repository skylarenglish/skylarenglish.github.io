## Game Report
Each after game report will include:
- Game Name
- Players in Place Order (winning player first, second second and so forth)
- Game start time
- Game end time
- Signatures of all players

Points will be calculated for the players automatically, as long as you submit your Game Report correctly.

## Points
Points[^points] will be awarded based on each Game Report such that first place is worth the number of minutes played and last place is worth half as many points as first. The other places will subdivide the gap between first and last evenly[^intent].

For example:
> Let's say Skylar, Paul, Zack and Les play a zesty game of Dune Imperium
>
> They play for 145 minutes and Les wins (due to his Mentat training, no doubt)
>
> Zack comes in second place, Paul third and poor foolish Skylar comes in fourth.
>
> | Player | Game Time   | Score           |
> | Les    | 145 minutes | 145*(6/6) = 145 |
> | Zack   | 145 minutes | 145*(5/6) = 121 |
> | Paul   | 145 minutes | 145*(4/6) = 97  |
> | Skylar | 145 minutes | 145*(3/6) = 73  |

## Conceding Is Encouraged
Once it becomes clear that a player is in the lead, especially if it seems like they are dragging the game out to earn extra points, the other players should consider conceding.
The game can only be conceded as long as all players besides the winner agree and sign the Game Report. What is written on the Game Report is final.

## The Great Houses
Max, Toph, Rachel, Zack and Karson are the scions of the Great Houses. If more than one of them are in a game then it is a Great Game and is worth 1.2x points to all players involved.

## Ronin
Jules, Brenna, Les, John N. and Paul get a single Challenge token for the day that they may issue to play a particular game against a player. In the case of a multiplayer game they may use their token to ensure a spot in the game. [^challenge]

## No Repeats
You may not play the same game back to back.

## No Tricks


[^points]: t * (1+((1-p)/(2n-2))) where t = time, p = place order, and n = # of players [^index]
[^intent]: The idea is to reward playing but still penalize losing while maintaining a simple scoring rule
[^index]: as an example of why 0 indexing is nice, this simplifies to t * (1-(p/(2n-2))) when first place is 0
[^challenge]: This challenge may not be refused. Adjudication of legality of challenges is reserved to Lords of Thank and Smas and we encourage people to spread out the challenges, not just all challenging Max, as funny as that would be.
